# Medical/Bio Research Topics 1
## 1. Course Description

In this class, introduction to brain imaging data as clinical data, explanation for processing brain imaging data, and practice in developing brain imaging-based artificial intelligence models are covered.


## 2. Prerequisites

For this class, knowledge of statistics at the undergraduate level and understanding of programming languages such as MATLAB, Python, and R are desired.


## 3. Course Format

Lecture	70%
Discussion/Presentation	30%

In this class, lectures on introduction to brain imaging data and processing of brain imaging data are given, and then students actually develop brain imaging-based artificial intelligence models and present and discuss the performance and interpretation of the developed models.


## 4. Course Objectives

Through this class, students understand the clinical implication of brain imaging data and secure knowledge and experience in the development of brain imaging-based artificial intelligence models.


## 5. Evaluation System

Midterm Exam 40%

Presentation 50%

Participation 10%

The degree of overall understanding of brain imaging data and knowledge about brain imaging data processing are evaluated through the midterm exam, and the development process and results of brain imaging-based artificial intelligence models are evaluated through presentation and discussion.
